## Explanation and evaluation of the design of the visualizations

This web application showcases the "Ease of Doing Business" across Europe and it has been developed in response to the European Commission's future investment plans. In their fight to reduce economic inequalities across Europe, a clear awareness over the ease of doing business across Europe could help the EU Commission develop more impactful and targeted investment initiatives. Thus, the main aim of this web application is to provide the EU Commission Leadership team with strategic and actionable insights regarding the current "Ease of Doing Busineess" Performance across Europe. This performance is measured focusing on the following four indicators from the last 5 years (2016 - 2020):

1. Getting Credit 
2. Resolving Insolvency
3. Starting a business
4. Trading across borders 

An additional indicator, "Overall Score" has been introduced to describe the average performance of each country throughout this timeframe. It is assumed that these 5 indicators best address the EU Team's interests and requirements. Therefore, reducing the scope to this 5 indicators has been a key factor to ensure that the visualizations are easy to interpret, insightful and relevant to the target audience. 

The web application is divided into three groups of visualization, each focused on addressing a specific question (identified in COMP0035). The required data used to answer each of the questions is from the Doing Business Database published by the World Bank https://databank.worldbank.org/source/doing-business. Nevertheless, each of the visualizations has been designed and coded in relation to the question. Therefore, it was necessary to have different versions of the cleaned and prepared dataset to answer the questions. For this reason, there are three different versions of the prepared dataset, each one with a specific data structured best addressing the three questions. 
The three questions that this web app aims to answer are:

1. Which countries have the lowest/highest Overall Score for every year and how does this compare with the European Average?
2. Which challenges have the European countries been facing from 2016 to 2020?
3. Across the four indicators, has the performance of each country been increasing or decreasing from 2016 to 2020?



The target audience of the web application is the EU Commission Leadership Team: a team of experienced leaders specialised in a particular sector (such as: legal, enviromental, economic). An example of the target aundience can be shown with the following persona: Robert Rossi, the Legislative Lead at the EU Commission. 

[Target Audience Persona - Robert Rossi.pdf](https://github.com/ucl-comp0035/coursework-1-MarcoLonardo/files/7507856/Target.Audience.Persona.-.Robert.Rossi.pdf)

As described in COMP0035 and considering the personas, we can expect the audience to be busy individuals accustomed to renown newspapers such as The Economist and the Financial Times. Moreover, it is also to consider that their familiarity with technology is unlikely to be strong. Therefore, the visualizations and the web app has been designed aiming for clarity, consiveness and intuitive filtering features.
